# Manjaro-Post-Install-Script

## Repository Archived

- I moved from Manjaro to Arch, so i "forked" this repository to create the [arch-post-install-script](https://github.com/MetaKomora/arch-post-install-script), which is continuing from where i left this and now i'm making this read-only.

Personal post installation script for Manjaro

Clone the script and execute with:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/MetaKomora/Manjaro-Post-Install-Script && cd Manjaro-Post-Install-Script;
chmod +x manjaro-post-install-script.sh;
./manjaro-post-install-script.sh
```
